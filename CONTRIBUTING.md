# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Hereâ€™s how you can add your opinion:

1. **Check if the country already has a file in `/countries/`.**  
   - If yes, open it and add your opinion to the `"opinions"` array.  
   - If no, create a new `{country}.json` file with the same structure.  

2. **Follow the JSON structure correctly.**  
   - Each opinion should include: 
     - `"nationality"`: The country you're from.  
     - `"opinion"`: Your thoughts on the country.  
     - `"date"`: The date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.  

3. **Submit a Pull Request.**  
   - Title it like `Added opinion for Japan`.  
   - Keep your changes simple and focused.  

Happy contributing! ðŸš€
